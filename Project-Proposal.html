    <h1>Project Proposal - Hyojin Lim</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The website that I intend to build for this project will center around movies. The website will include
            information about movie reccomendation for specific genres or moods. Along with the recommendations, the
            movies may have brief reviews about them.</li>
        <li>I've often found the movies recommended by Netflix and other streaming sites to be poor, so I'm hoping to
            manually create a customized list of recommendations that I think are better suited for each genre/mood.
            This website will provide the best movies to watch for each genre or mood.</li>
        <li>This site is targeted for people who are indecisive in choosing a movie to watch at home. </li>
        <li>This is still a working progress. But I think the home page will have some personal movie recommendations of
            mine. There will be one page with movie reviews. There will also be a page with movie recommendations
            accordingly to each movie genre and/or mood.</li>

    </ul>
